    <h1>Welcome to Honest And Adventurous!</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      We made this game because we noticed that the party games we play are
      basically the same ones we played as kids in college. We wanted to make a
      game that takes advantage of years of friendship and built-up trust and
      respect and lets you have fun you couldn't have had when you were just a
      kid. And we all like an excuse to talk about dirty stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      We wanted to make a version of truth or dare that wasn't about shame, but
      was about giving prompts opening up and doing adventurous things. So we
      called this Honest And Adventurous. It's doing stupid stuff, but it can be
      even crazier because it's in a safe setting, not kids looking for stuff to
      laugh at you about. To be clear - this is a game for adults. It's not
      innocent, and it ranges all the way from PG-13 to X-rated. It's still
      about having silly fun, and you will be laughing a lot, but college kids
      probably wouldn't be able to handle it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The game starts off quite lightweight, and gets more intimate as it goes
      on. When we were first testing the game, we discovered that the kind of
      things we wanted to talk about and do changed as the game went on and we
      loosened up, so we've tried to reflect that. The challenges are randomly
      chosen, but possibilities are added and removed as the game goes on to
      create a gradual change.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you don't feel that you would share absolutely ANYTHING with the people
      you're with, or that you wouldn't do ANYTHING with them (and we mean
      anything), don't play. Also it helps a lot if you all think each other are
      at least a little attractive!

      This game is still a work in progress. Please give feedback at
      bettercards@gmail.com.
