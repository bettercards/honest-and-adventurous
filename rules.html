    <h1>Rules</h1>
    <p>
      Before we start on how to play, we've got some advice. There have been
      times where people have played the game, had an amazing time, then gone to
      bed and the next day they feel super-awkward or ashamed because they went
      a bit crazy the night before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before you start, agree with each other that you are going to leave shame
      and embarrassment at the door. That stuff was for when you were a kid, but
      you're adult friends now and you can handle putting yourself out there in
      each other's company.
    </p>
    <p>
      After you play the game, don't just go to bed. We like to call it a
      "debrief" - a conversation you have about all the crazy fun you've just
      had together. It makes a big difference and we provide a list of points
      you might want to talk about for that purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also agree with each other that anyone can say "time out" at any point for
      any reason. You might want to stop completely or more often just need a
      minute. This is fine, and you could make a fun rule about it. One we like
      to do is if someone calls a time out, everyone else has to drink.
    </p>
    <p>The basic gameplay is as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Each turn has a "caller" and a "doer". Everyone takes turns to be the
        caller, and the doer is picked by the game. This takes annoying
        decision-making (or bottle-spinning) out of the equation.
      </li>
      <li>
        On each turn, the caller asks the doer to choose Honesty or Adventure.
        When the doer chooses, the caller clicks the button in the game and
        reads the screen to the doer.
      </li>
      <li>
        If they've chosen honesty, the doer should answer the question. We also
        encourage <i>everyone</i>
        to answer the question too. We all want to talk about stuff!
      </li>
      <li>
        If they've chosen adventure, the doer should perform the task. Many
        tasks involve the caller <i>and</i> the doer, and in those situations
        the doer can shout "swap!" to swap the roles. We also encourage everyone
        to join in with the adventure if possible, and if they want to.
      </li>
      <li>
        A lot of the adventures have a minimum amount of time. But there's no
        maximum. If everyone's enjoying the adventure, carry on as long as you
        like!
      </li>
      <li>
        We like to set a rule where you can skip an Honesty if you remove one
        item of clothing, and skip an adventure if you remove two.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the task is finished, pass the phone (or whatever) to the next
        caller and repeat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prompts will occasionally appear on screen asking if you'd like to add
        new categories of questions to the game, and so on. Just answer these
        however you like.
      </li>
      <li>
        By default, the game will keep running as long as you like. After a long
        while there will be no "honesty" choices left, so it's all adventure.
        You may see those start to repeat if you keep playing a really long
        time, but we've never made it that far.
      </li>
      <li>
        Don't forget to debrief! There is always a link at the bottom of the
        screen to go to the debrief helper.
      </li>
      <li>
        After the debrief, you've all won. Congratulations!
      </li>
    </ul>
