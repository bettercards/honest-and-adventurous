        <h1>Rules</h1>
        <p>The basic gameplay is as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Each turn has a "caller", who holds the device, and a "doer". Everyone takes turns to be the caller, and
                the doer is picked by the game. This takes annoying decision-making (or bottle-spinning) out of the
                equation.
            </li>
            <li>
                On each turn, the caller asks the doer to choose Truth or Dare. When the doer chooses, the caller clicks
                the button in the game and reads the screen to the doer.
            </li>
            <li>If they've chosen truth, the doer should answer the question.</li>
            <li>
                If they've chosen dare, the doer should perform the task. Many tasks involve the caller <i>and</i> the
                doer, and in those situations the doer can shout "swap!" to swap the roles, at the cost of removing one
                item of clothing. We also encourage everyone to join in with the dare if possible, it's more fun.
            </li>
            <li>A lot of the dares have a minimum amount of time. But there's no maximum.</li>
            <li>
                You can skip a truth or dare if you don't want to do it. But you have to remove one item of clothing.
            </li>
            <li>When the task is finished, pass the phone (or whatever) to the next caller and repeat.</li>
            <li>Stop whenever you want, or when the games runs out of truths and dares.</li>
            <li>When you finish, you've all won. Congratulations!</li>
        </ul>
